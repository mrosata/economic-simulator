  deficitImpact:
    "The effect of economic events on the government's annual deficit. A positive number means the deficit increased, requiring more borrowing. Influenced by economic shocks, policy changes, and unexpected events.",
  gdpGrowth:
    "The annual percentage increase in Gross Domestic Product. Healthy economies typically grow at 2-3% annually. Higher growth helps reduce debt-to-GDP ratio even without reducing nominal debt.",
  inflationRate:
    "The annual rate at which prices increase. The Federal Reserve typically targets 2% as optimal. Higher inflation can reduce the real value of debt but may harm economic stability.",
  interestRate:
    "The percentage cost of borrowing money. Represents what the government pays on its debt. Lower rates make debt more sustainable, while higher rates increase the cost burden of existing debt.",
  debtToGDP:
    "National debt as a percentage of GDP. This ratio is more important than absolute debt size. Levels below 60% are generally considered sustainable, while ratios above 100% may raise concerns.",
  debtPerCapita:
    "The amount of national debt per person. Calculated by dividing total debt by population. Provides perspective on individual share of national debt, though citizens aren't personally liable for it.",
  debtAssessment:
    "Evaluates the sustainability of the national debt based on debt-to-GDP ratio and its trend over time. Lower ratios and downward trends are more favorable.",
  growthAssessment:
    "Measures the health of economic growth throughout the simulation. Strong, consistent growth helps manage debt burden and improves fiscal sustainability.",
  stabilityAssessment:
    "Evaluates economic volatility by tracking recessions, booms, and overall economic stability. More stable economies are better able to manage debt obligations.",
  interestBurden:
    "Measures interest payments as a percentage of GDP. Lower percentages indicate more manageable debt servicing costs and greater fiscal flexibility.",
  overallAssessment:
    "Comprehensive evaluation combining debt levels, economic growth, stability, and interest burden to provide a holistic view of fiscal health.",
  realDebtChange:
    "The percentage change in debt adjusted for inflation, showing the true change in debt burden over time.",
  gdpChange:
    "The percentage change in GDP over the simulation period, indicating overall economic expansion or contraction.",
  debtRatioChange:
    "The percentage point change in the debt-to-GDP ratio over the simulation period. Negative values indicate improving fiscal sustainability.",
  overallScore:
    "A numerical score (0-20) summarizing overall fiscal health, with higher scores indicating better outcomes across all metrics.",
